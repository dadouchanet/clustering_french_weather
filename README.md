# clustering_french_weather
The aim of this project is to perform a segmentation of the French territory based on
Temperature and Wind time series gathered at n = 259 grid points using different clustering
methods.

## The datasets
In this machine learning project, we have three datasets :
- dataTemp.csv provides the temporal evolution of the temperature at an hourly sampling
rate for a given year (p = 8760 hours) for 259 grid points,
- dataWind.csv provides the temporal evolution of the wind speed at an hourly sampling rate
for a given year (p = 8760 hours) for 259 grid points,
- dataGPS.csv provides the GPS positions (longitude and latitude) of the 259 time series grid
points. The grid points are located as follow on the French territory
